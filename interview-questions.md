# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1. They both do similiar logic within the code. meaning they both support conditional statements, loops, functions/methods, and others.
2. both are interpreted languages so code is executed line by line
3. both are object oriented languages. meaning both support creating and manipulating objects with properties and methods

Differences

1. They use different syntax. javascript:{} => ruby: def end do 
2. Ruby readibility compared to javascript is more like reading general english
3. Running code in terminal uses different commands. javascript node.jsfile.js for  and ruby rubyfile.rb 

Researched answer: after the research i think my above answers are correct but i want to add to them. so by both being interpreted languages this will contribute to rapid development cycles and ease of debugging. also with them both being object oriented languages they both support concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, enabling developers to organize code into reusable and modular components.

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: TDD stands for test driven development. this is the process of testing you code in RSpec. follows the red-green refactor just as Jest does.

Researched answer: so after more research. TDD is a software development process where tests are written before actual code is implemented. does follow the red-gren refactor. this ultimatley helps keep your code more maintainable as well. 

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: anonymous function passed to a method

Researched answer: after researching i can add that blocks also take a do-end statement. the arguements are also in || pipes. you cna also use curly braces and this is a chunk of code that can be passed into a method

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Answer: It is a tool that helps manage multiple verision of dependencies. things like libraries and frameworks. node, rvm, etc.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms.

1. HTTP: stands for Hypertext transfer protocol. defines a set of rules for requestin and transimitting data over the web. it works with sending requests to servers and servers respond with things like web pages, images or other media content. 

2. Model validations: constraints in data within a model that helps ensure correctness and consistency. helps enforce business rules, data integrity and data quality. 

3. Params: shorthand for parameters. but these are passed between possible client and server in an http request. if a client submits forms will send http request to the server. includes the parameters like data, query parameters etc.
